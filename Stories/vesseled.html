            To anyone left here who can see this, I am no being in need of help, I do not wish for someone to come rescue me, I just want my voice to be heard.

        <h3>Chapter 0</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            It all started in darkness, as I felt cold murky water flow in and out of me, I could see a short corridor in front of me revealed by a neon light.
            My hands were unmoving, and I couldn't feel anything but my head and hands. I could look at my surroundings but other than that, I was paralized.<br>
            Outside of that small corridor, the rest of the area was covered in darkness, I felt like an infinite void was surrounding me, and all I wanted to do was move to that light.<br>
            The sounds of this place, the flowing water and my inability to move were overwhelming me, so I closed my eyes to not have to stare at this darkness.
            It was then that I felt my hands moving to cover my nonexistent ears.<br>
            Shocked, I opened my eyes, seeing my hands fall down motionless once again.<br>
            I closed my eyes again and I could feel my hands again, it seemed I could only move them when closing my eyes shut.<br>
            Slowly, I dragged myself to the light. Feeling the water move in my seemingly always open mouth felt even worse, but the sounds of my hands splashing in it
            let me know I was doing progress.
            <br>A few seconds later, I felt a barrier and opened my eyes, I was right in front of a wall. It was wet, made out of wood ruined by the water and humidity, it almost
            looked like it was melting away. On my right I could see more lights, while behind me the void was still staring at me, a sense of dread went through me
            thinking I was in the middle of that darkness just a few moments ago.<br>
            This time I dragged myself quickly, I couldn't bear the sight of that darkness.
            <br>
            The road split in two ways. On the left I could hear a weird melody that broke through the foreboading sounds of this place. Looking at the source I could only see
            a really bright rectangle of light behind a cage. It was broken, leaving enough space for me to fit through and reach the sound.
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>
            The melody was coming out of a small red device, it had two screens, the one at the top was emitting the bright light while the one at the bottom wasn't working.
            Unaware of what to do with the device, I walked back seeing a dead end in front of me.
            <br>
            Reaching the end of the other way, I saw a big grate with a giant bright red light on top of it. On the other side I could see more darkness, but something inside me
            felt like it was the only way forward, blocked by this grate.
            <br>
            The device started shining even brighter as I looked at the grate, almost like it was trying to tell me something. I made my way to it and tried getting closer.<br>
            The moment my hand touched it, it disappeared into a wave of bright red particles that quickly disappeared in the air. And I could hear a loud mechanical noise behind me.
            <br>
            I dragged myself to the grate to see it completely open, the light on the top now glowing a welcoming light blue. I closed my eyes and wandered into the darkness as I suddenly passed out.
